  <h2 class='c005'>MISS PECK’S ADVENTURES.</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c006' />
<p class='c007'>Any people who may happen to have read
the story of “Wilful, the Conceited Pig,”
will recollect how he had called up his friend,
Miss Peck, one night, from the henhouse,
where there had been a great disagreement
between her and Cock-a-doodle, and how
they had set off together to the Queen’s
house, to tell Her Majesty some very curious
news; also how they had very soon parted
company, not being able to agree as to which
was the right road, and how Wilful’s journey
had come to a very sad end, long before he
was anywhere near the palace of Her Majesty
the Queen. Now they may also like to
know something of Miss Peck’s adventures;
and I am therefore going to relate them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>thinking that, perhaps, we may find almost
as much to take warning by, in her history,
as in Wilful’s conceit, and the terrible punishment
it met with.</p>
<p class='c008'>Miss Peck felt rather lonely at first, when
she found herself out in the dusky lane alone,
at that time of night; but still she could not
help chuckling to think how Wilful had persisted
in taking the wrong road, and was
travelling all for nothing, whilst she was sure
to reach the Queen’s house in time, if her
poor legs would but carry her far enough.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There is no need to go so fast, at any
rate,” she thought to herself. “If we got
to the palace so early in the morning very
likely Her Majesty the Queen would not be
up, as I would have told Wilful, only he
never will stop to listen to a word one has to
say. Why our old David at home never
gets up to give us our breakfast till Cock-a-doodle
has walked round the yard several
times, talked to all his family, told them his
dreams—which, I must, say, I am very tired
of hearing—and crowed over and over again.
I am sure if it were not for the early walk
into the rick-pen, which I make a point of
taking every morning, and the little bit of
support that I get there, I should be dead with
hunger long before breakfast time; but nobody
ever seems to remember how delicate my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>health is, and old David would not get up a
bit the sooner, I verily believe, if I were dying.
However, it is better than if Betsy Chopper
had the feeding of us entirely, for I know that
the smoke never begins to come out of the
kitchen chimney till a little while before she
gives us our dinner, and what the family do
for something to eat I never can think.
The poor ladies, I know, never look out of
window or get a breath of air till the middle
of the day in summer, and I believe they
have no rick-pen to go to, and are obliged
to wait till Betsy Chopper chooses to get
up and feed them. The Queen may very
likely not be as late as Betsy Chopper; but
it is ten to one if she is as early as old
David, so there can be no occasion to hurry
oneself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So Miss Peck walked on in a leisurely
manner, picking her way along the dirty lane,
as well as the darkness would allow, and
every now and then stopping a minute or
two to rest her poor legs by turns.</p>

<p class='c008'><a id='pg8'></a>Now not very far from Miss Peck’s own
residence there stood a poor tumble-down
cottage, in which lived an old woman, who
kept a thin tortoiseshell cat and a little poultry.
And on each side of the small wicket-gate
leading to the cottage—which was close
to the lane—stood a very thick yew-tree, cut
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>into the form of a sugar-loaf at the top.
Miss Peck was not brave, and when she
reached this part of the lane, and saw, as
she thought, two black giants, with plumes
on their heads, standing not far before her,
she was so horribly frightened that she
screamed with all her might, and was very
near running back the way she came, faster
than she had ever run before. However,
she had just resolution enough to stop and
think what was best to be done, when,
strange to say, one of the giants seemed to
cry out Cock-a-doodle-doo, in a voice of
thunder, and, all at once, came flapping
down upon poor Miss Peck, rolling her over
in the mud, and nearly driving all the breath
out of her body with the shock and the
terror. Getting on her legs again somehow
or other, she ran behind a little heap of
stones, where she stood panting and trembling,
and with ruffled feathers, when again
the same hateful cry rang in her ears, repeated
three times, even louder than before—“Cock-a-doodle-doo,
Cock-a-doodle-doo,
Cock-a-doodle-doo!” Scarcely daring to
look round, and expecting every instant to be
swallowed up alive, or torn to pieces by one
of the giants, Miss Peck wished herself safe
at home again, with all her might, in spite
of Cock-a-doodle’s tyranny, when, luckily,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>there came a faint gleam of light, and she
saw, as she thought, Cock-a-doodle himself
sitting on the top of the little wicket-gate
between the two yew-trees. Could it have
been he who had given her such a fright on
purpose, or had he come out all this way to
find her, and bring her home, and tell her
how sorry he was not to have shown her
more attention? She crept a little nearer,
and, hoping to move his pity, gave a faint
cry, as if she were in great pain and distress.
“Who is that?” said a voice, which was not
Cock-a-doodle’s; and Miss Peck replied directly
“that she was an unfortunate young
person who was travelling across the country
on business of importance, and she hoped
that the gentleman to whom she was speaking,
whoever he might be, would take pity
upon her, and protect her from the dangers
which surrounded her, for, indeed, she never
was so frightened in all her life, and she did
not know how she should ever find courage
to continue her journey.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, madam, might I ask,” said the
gentleman on the gate, “what the important
business is, which obliges you to be on the
road at this time of night?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will tell you, sir, with the greatest
pleasure,” said Miss Peck, “although my
poor nerves are so shaken that I can scarcely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>speak, but if you could come a little nearer
I should not be obliged to talk so loud.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, you will not disturb the old woman,”
said her new acquaintance, “and
as to the old cat, I saw her go by some time
ago, and I believe she is spending the evening
with the young jackdaws, who live in
the church-roof. She has taken a great
fancy to that family lately, and says that she
finds them very agreeable, though shy; but
I should doubt whether they were very fond
of <i>her</i>, for you must know, madam, that the
old cat is, in my opinion, one of the most
conceited and selfish persons that ever lived,
and if the old woman knew all her bad ways
I do not think that she could allow her to
continue in the house.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, indeed!” said Miss Peck, “well
do I know, sir, what it is to have to do with
that sort of people. From your account I
should fear that the old cat was very little
better than Cock-a-doodle himself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Peck then proceeded to give a long
history of Cock-a-doodle’s unkindness to her,
her own dreadful sufferings from spasms,
which deprived her of her natural rest,—Miss
Spangle’s spitefulness, in continuing
fast asleep without once offering to help her,—and
then the whole account of Wilful’s
visit to the henhouse, and their setting off
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>together to tell the Queen that the stars
were falling out of the sky.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And now, sir,” added Miss Peck, “perhaps
you will do me the great kindness to
tell me your name, for I have no doubt now,
that it was entirely owing to your interference,
that I was not swallowed alive by
one of those horrible giants, which gave me
such an alarm just now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My name, madam,” answered the
stranger, “is Cockielockie, at your service,
but I think, owing to your youth and inexperience,
you have probably mistaken these
two respectable old yew trees, in one of
which the seven ladies of my family are
sleeping at this moment, for giants, or perhaps
their shadows across the road deceived
you, or it might be the old cat returning
from her visit to the Jackdaws. At any
rate, madam, here are no giants, I assure
you, for the truth is that the old woman
leads such a dull life that no giant ever
comes near the place, and I have not seen
so much as the face of Tim Scamp, the
little pedlar, for the last six months. It is
very sad to live so out of the world, and I
must confess that I should like a little more
society. The old woman is so particular
and old-fashioned; and the cat is so ill-mannered
and vulgar, that it is very trying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>to one’s patience, and I do not find much
comfort in my own family, for I am sorry to
say that they are always quarrelling. I
cannot speak to one without the other’s
being jealous, and to tell the truth, (though
I am sure you will not repeat it,) I was
awoke just now by the screams of my two
daughters, Partridge and Speckle, who had
had their ears boxed by Mrs. Cockielockie,
for saying that they knew I wished she was
dead! If I do wish it, they need not have
told her so, and now I shall never hear the
last of it. If I could but get away for a
time, it might blow over, or Mrs. Cockielockie
might be gone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, my dear sir,” said Miss Peck,
interrupting him, “why cannot you come
with me to the Queen? It would be an
opportunity of introducing yourself to the
very highest society, and I should be delighted
with the honour of your company.
Indeed, I really feel very lonely, travelling
all by myself, and am very much in want of
protection, which is just what I am sure, sir,
you are always ready to afford to a poor
weak young creature, like myself, though
whenever one complains of helplessness, it
seems to make some people, that I could
mention, more spiteful and tyrannical than
ever!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>“Believe me, dear madam,” said Cockielockie,—who
was very much pleased at the
idea of paying a visit to the Queen,—“believe
me, that never could be my case,
I will accompany you instantly with the
greatest pleasure, and I trust that, if we
should meet with any enemies on the road
you will find my spurs quite able to defend
you from them. Under these circumstances,
madam, I shall set off without giving my
usual crow, which, hitherto, I have never
failed to perform at this hour. It was my
dear mother’s first and last lesson to me.
She took the greatest pains to teach it me
when young, and I remember how vexed she
used to be when I forgot my crows, or cut
them so short that no one could understand
what I said, or did not repeat them exactly
at the right time. She told me that if I
went on so I should be good for nothing,
and might as well be boiled at once; and
the last thing she said to me, before she
disappeared, and I fear was boiled herself,
was, ‘Cockie, mind your crows.’ To tell
the truth, however, now, my dear Miss
Peck, I am afraid of waking the ladies in
the yew-tree. Mrs. Cockielockie would
make such a fuss, and then the old woman
might be disturbed, for though she is very
deaf, I have heard the cat say that she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>always hears when you most wish she should
not; for there was a small piece of the tail
of a red herring which she promised one
evening at supper to give to her,—at least
so Mrs. Puss told me,—and then she put it
away in the cupboard, and went to bed, and
forgot it! So the cat being hungry, could
not go to sleep, and was just getting into the
cupboard, to eat her own bit of fish, when
down came the old woman to know what all
that scratching and scrambling was about,
and the cat was forced to pretend to be
catching a mouse, and never got the herring
after all, for the old woman locked it up,
and took the key away with her. I think,
therefore, madam, although it seems to be
neglecting one’s duties, that we had better
set off as quietly as possible.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So saying, Cockielockie shook himself
gently, brushed his feathers, scraped his
claws, and then came down from the little
wicket-gate, on which he had all this time
been sitting, and asked Miss Peck if she
was now ready to go on.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Peck, having quite recovered from
her fright, had been impatient to proceed on
her journey all the time that Cockielockie
was talking, so on they went, talking pleasantly
all the way of their different sufferings,
and the hard trials they each of them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>met with from undeserved persecutions at
home.</p>

<p class='c008'>And they went, and they went, and they
went down the lane, round the turning, and
up the hill to the left, till they saw something
white moving slowly on before them
which, when they came nearer, seemed to
be a duck, but its head hung down so
wretchedly, its wings were so drooping, and
its whole air so forlorn, that Miss Peck
herself doubted, at first, what it could be.
But when they came quite close, they saw
that they were not mistaken, so Cockielockie,
who had always a word for everybody,
said in a cheerful manner:</p>

<p class='c008'>“How do you do, Duckiedaddles? You
are up early this dark morning. Where
may you be going to, if I may venture to
ask the question?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The duck shook her head sadly, heaved
a sigh, and said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Cockielockie, I am a poor wretched
creature, who can find no pleasure in life,
and have had great misfortunes, and so I am
going to consult an old friend, who lives a
little way off, about making my will, and
then return home, and hang myself in the
well rope, behind the carthouse.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, pray, my dear madam,” exclaimed
Miss Peck, “pray do not say such shocking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>things, or you will quite overcome me, for
my feelings are very soon upset, owing to
my unfortunate spasms. I am sure that my
friend, Cockielockie, will be able to do
everything in the world for you, if you will
only explain the case to him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you, Hennypenny,” answered
the duck, while her tears fell fast: “I will
tell you all about it, though I fear that
Cockielockie will never be able to do me
any good. My sorrow is owing to my
having had my family taken away from
me, and my own little ones brought up by
a stranger, and one of the last persons whom
I should ever have chosen to put them
under. One evening I was returning home,
having been out for a little walk round the
shrubbery with my friend Mrs. Gobble,
when I found that my nest was taken away,
and so the tiresome life that I had been
leading, sitting there, day after day, for
hours together, was all trouble for nothing.
It was the third time that the very same
thing had happened to me, and whether it
was one of Master Samuel’s mischievous
tricks, or, whether Jem, the old carter, who
was always meddling with what did not
concern him, was at the bottom of it, I
could not guess, for I was then far from
suspecting the right person; and so was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Mrs. Gobble, for I went to her directly, and
though she was sorry to see me vexed, she
said it was a good thing that I should not
have to stay at home so much, for she was
sure I must have been nearly moped to
death, and she would not have led such a
dull life, for all the little yellow ducklings
that ever were seen. So I got over my
disappointment as well as I could, and I
remember that a party of us went out walking
that evening, and the weather was
beautiful, pouring rain every minute, and
puddles running here and there, and everything
so nice and wet, and I caught eleven
large slugs, and felt much more contented.
Indeed I had quite forgotten all about it,
when, a long time afterwards, as I was
coming in from a swimming match with
some friends, one morning, what should I
see but six or seven handsome little yellow
ducklings, running in and out of a new
house, which stood not far from the water.
I looked very hard at them, for I suspected
how it was, and as I passed close to the
house, which was open in front, I looked in,
and saw Mrs. Topknot sitting there as grand
as could be, and spreading herself out as if
she did not know how to be proud enough.
She was always giving herself airs, I must
tell you, and never was so civil to me as she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>ought to have been, but being of a meek
disposition myself, I just stopped for a
minute, and said, ‘Good morning, Mrs.
Topknot. Whose is this lovely young family
that you seem to have about you?’
‘Whose?’ she answered, as shortly as
possible. ‘Why your own to be sure, Mrs.
Daddles, and I am going to bring them up,
for everybody knows that you are such a
gossiping, gadabout creature, that you are
not fit to have the management of a family.
You may think yourself very lucky that
your young ones should be placed under the
charge of such a wise and well-informed person
as I am, instead of being left to shift for
themselves, as they would be if they depended
upon your care.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“I was so full of grief and anger at hearing
this speech, that I could hardly speak,
and, as if to enrage me still more, Mrs.
Topknot called out to the ducklings to come
to her directly, and I saw that the little
dears did not dare to disobey her; so in
they ran, and she shuffled them all under
her wings, and would not even let me look
at them, but one got his head half-out, and
peeped at me, as much as to say, that if he
could do as he liked, he would not be
squeezed up in that way long.</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘And do you really mean to refuse to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>let me take away my own little ducklings,
Mrs. Topknot?’ said I, ‘because, in that
case I shall go immediately to Jem, the
carter, and get him to wring your neck!’</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mrs. Topknot only gave a scornful
laugh and answered, ‘As if anybody would
mind what you said, indeed! You should
have stayed at home, and attended to your
own affairs instead of always sauntering
about with that lazy Mrs. Gobble. Be
thankful that your family are sure of a good
education. I shall not allow them to get
into any of the dirty, dabbling ways, that
you, and all your relations, are so fond of, I
can tell you!’</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Very well, Mrs. Topknot,’ I answered:
‘I see you think yourself wiser than everybody
else, as usual; but depend upon it,
though you may bring up very good
chickens, you will never make good ducklings
as long as you live. It is quite a
different thing, and so I shall tell Jem, the
carter, since he has not the sense to know it
already. Pray can you swim, Mrs. Topknot?
Can you earn an independent living
in a gutter? Can you eat slugs? You
know that you, and all your family, are
poor, helpless, delicate creatures, afraid of
getting your feet wet, and obliged to live on
the charity of Jem, the carter. How should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>you be able to bring up young ducklings to
do their duty in their own station? You
are quite mistaken if you expect ever to
make chickens of them. I know by the
look of their feet, that they will take to the
water in spite of you, and then pray what
will you do? Just let them come with me,
and I will soon show you what little ducklings
are made for. You have no right to
keep my children squeezed up in that
corner, where they can scarcely breathe.
I know you will kill them before you have
done.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“So I went on, begging and praying Mrs.
Topknot to restore to me my own family,
and even shedding tears to move her pity,
but all in vain. She would not mind a word
I said, and, in the greatest affliction, I went
off to Mrs. Gobble, to ask her opinion about
what was to be done. But Mrs. Gobble
was just going out walking with a friend,
and would hardly find time to listen to my
story. She only said, that if I thought Jem,
the carter, would understand anything about
it, I should only be disappointed, for he was
always doing the most foolish things, and
making mischief in the yard in almost every
family. I felt, therefore, that it was not of
the least use to complain to him, for he
would have been quite as likely to wring my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>neck, as Mrs. Topknot’s, and being weary
of such an unkind world, and Mrs. Gobble
not asking me to go with her and her friend
I determined to hang myself in the well-rope,
as I said; only as I have a small piece
of cabbage-leaf behind the pig-sty, and two
young snails in a corner of the garden-wall,
I think it best to make my will; for, my
dear Mr. Cockielockie, and Mrs. Hennypenny,
you must now see that my distress is
too great to admit of any relief.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My name,” said Miss Peck, rather angrily,
as soon as Duckiedaddles ceased speaking,
“is not Hennypenny, Mrs. Daddles;
and I must say, though extremely sorry for
your misfortunes, that I think grief must have
confused your mind a little, or you would not
have made such a mistake about a young
person like myself. My name is Miss Peck,
and I and my friend Mr. Cockielockie are
on our way to Her Most Gracious Majesty
the Queen, to tell her that the stars are all
falling out of the sky.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I think, Mrs. Daddles,” interrupted
Cockielockie, “that you cannot do better
than come along with us, and then you will
have an opportunity of laying your melancholy
case before Her Majesty, who very
likely will order Mrs. Topknot and Jem the
carter’s heads to be sent to her immediately;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>for I know she is particular about her own
family, and would be very angry if any
one were to take them away from her, and
instead of letting them grow into good little
kings and queens, with crowns on their
heads, as they ought to do, were to try to
make them wear topknots and live upon
barley meal.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Daddles was very willing to agree to
Cockielockie’s proposal, for, as she said, she
could see about making her will when she
came back. So they went, and they went,
and they went, until, turning a corner of the
lane, what should they see walking towards
them, in a grave and solemn manner, but a
goose.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good morning, Duckiedaddles, Cockielockie,
Hennypenny,” said she, bowing very
politely at the same time.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My name, madam,” said the unlucky
Peck, taking care to answer before the
others, “my name is Miss Peck; but you
are quite correct as to my two companions,
Mr. Cockielockie and Mrs. Duckiedaddles,
who have had the kindness to accompany
me on a journey of great importance, which
it has been my duty to undertake. And I
am sure, unused as I am to travelling alone,
I do not know what I should do without the
support of their society. Will you allow me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>to ask, Mrs. Goosiepoosie, where you are
going to so early in the morning?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am going,” answered Mrs. Goosiepoosie,
putting on an air of great importance,
“to make an early visit to Her Majesty the
Queen, on very pressing business.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“To the Queen!” they all exclaimed at
once. “Pray, madam, do us the favour to
tell us your errand?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, to tell the truth,” replied Goosiepoosie,
“it is a secret known only at present
to my own family, but I have no objection to
mentioning it so to such respectable people as
yourselves, as I am sure you are quite to be
trusted. You are aware that I and all my
family have been accustomed from generation
to generation, to dress in white, and
have hitherto allowed our young ones to
wear coats of the same colour as soon as they
are old enough to take care of them. But
at last we have quite grown tired of this
style of dress. It was very well for our
grandfathers and grandmothers, but now it
looks old-fashioned and dowdy, and, besides
requires a great deal of washing, which
makes it expensive; and so I am going to
beg the Queen to give an order for our
having in future black coats, which will be
much more becoming, and will entitle us to
as high a place in society as the Turkey
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>family, who now give themselves such airs
and graces over us—as if an old-fashioned
British goose, whose family has belonged to
the country and supported the state in all
times, and has led an honest and quiet life
from father to son, were not much more respectable
than such upstarts as themselves,
who half ruin all their friends, and cannot
speak English so as to be understood.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very true, madam,” exclaimed Cockielockie,
“your observations have a great deal
of weight, only I almost wonder that you
should wish to adopt any imitation of the
dress of these foreigners, instead of retaining
that which your grandfathers and grandmothers
seem to have found the most comfortable
and convenient, and, I am sure,
would never have changed for the sake of
making themselves more like the Turkeys.
If you are tired of white, why do you not
ask leave to wear brown and red coats like
ours, which have always been very much
admired, and are so much handsomer than
black ones?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, sir,” rejoined Mrs. Goosiepoosie,
“I do not see that your coats are any better
than our own; and it is not very likely that
Father Gander and all the heads of the
family would have sent me off on such a
long journey to Her Majesty just to ask her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>leave to change our dress, for no reason at
all.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I thought you said, madam, just now,”
replied Cockielockie, rather slyly, “that you
found your old white coats dowdy and expensive.
I much fear, however, that you
will be obliged to wear them some little
time longer yet, for as you are going exactly
the wrong way, it is not probable that you
will ever reach the palace of Her Majesty
the Queen.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I beg your pardon,” replied Goosiepoosie,
“but as I consulted old Father Gander
before I started, and have carefully
attended to his directions, which were to
keep straight on, without turning to the
right leg or to the left, I cannot possibly
have gone wrong.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” exclaimed Miss Peck, rather
sharply, “I can only tell you, madam, that
<i>we</i> are now on our way to the residence of
Her Majesty, on very important business
indeed, and as we have already travelled
some distance, we expect very shortly to
arrive there. It is not likely that persons of
our rank in life should not know where our
gracious Sovereign lives, having, of course,
often heard the bells ring on her birthday,
and also assisted Betsy Chopper in clearing
away the crumbs, after a feast that was given
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>us in honour of it, on a large table, under
the chestnut trees, not very long ago. There
were a great many cakes and curious things
to eat, but the naughty children came
swarming round the table, and stole them,
before we knew of it, though they were all
intended for us; so even Cock-a-doodle got
nothing better than crumbs—and good
enough for him, too. He gave Miss Spangle
one of the largest he found, and never
offered me a bit, although I was leaning
against one leg of the table, close to him, at
the time, and suffering agonies of pain from
a sudden attack of cramp in my poor leg.
But such is the way I have always been
treated. However, madam, I can assure you
that you had much better attend to what we
say, and not go on in this direction, or you
will never get to your journey’s end.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I am much obliged to you, madam, for
your good advice,” replied Goosiepoosie, with
a formal bow, “but Father Gander is certain
to be right, and I shall continue to follow
the road which he pointed out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then you are an obstinate goose for your
pains,” cried Cockielockie, much provoked,
“and may wear your vulgar white coat all
your life, for any chance there is of the
Queen’s giving you leave to change it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Goosiepoosie made a very angry reply,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>and the quarrel might have continued to
this time, but just then old Simon Joggle,
the carrier, was coming along the road, and
so loud and vehement had been the dispute
that they did not hear the wheels of his cart
till it was quite close to them. He was
driving pretty fast, and they were standing
near the middle of the road, so that there
was scarcely time to get out of the way. The
unfortunate Miss Peck screamed violently,
and in her agitation, not thinking where
she was going, she ran under one of the cart
wheels, and it was no longer any joke about
her poor left leg, for the wheel went over it
and broke the bone.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her cries were so terrible, and there was
such noise and confusion, and flapping of
wings, at the same instant, that old Simon,
who could not see in the glimmering light
what was the matter, stopped his horse and
got out of the cart. Poor Miss Peck, whose
screams soon showed him where she was,
tried to get away when he came near her,
but she only fell down in great pain whenever
she attempted to move. If the cramp
in her leg, from which she used to suffer so
much, especially when she was cross, had
disabled her half as much as this sad accident,
Cock-a-doodle could never have been
so barbarous as to refuse to help her up the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>henhouse stairs, if fifty Miss Spangles had
been near him at the same time. It was in
vain that she struggled, and screamed, and
scrambled along the ground. She was soon
in old Simon’s clutches, who was quickly
sitting in his cart again, with the reins in
his hand, as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p class='c008'>But I fear that something very sad <i>had</i>
happened; and I am quite sure, whatever
might be her fate, that poor Miss Peck
was never more seen or heard of, although
Cock-a-doodle thought it right to make every
inquiry after her, and was very much
shocked at the report which was whispered
about the yard the next morning, that she
had escaped from the henhouse, and gone off
on a journey with young Master Wilful the
conceited pig.</p>

<p class='c008'>But what became of Cockielockie, Goosiepoosie,
and Duckiedaddles? They had suffered
a terrible fright, and almost lost their
senses, when old Simon’s cart came so suddenly
upon them; Duckiedaddles, being the
last to see the danger, in her haste, somehow
knocked herself against one of the horse’s
legs, and was so stunned by the blow that
she lay for some minutes quite insensible.
When she recovered she could see nothing
of her companions; old Simon’s cart was
just moving away, and there was a shrieking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>sound from the inside, which Duckie thought—but
it might have been fancy—must be
like the voice of Miss Peck in a very bad
spasm. When the cart was quite out of
sight, Duckie hobbled along till she came to
a little brook that crossed the road, and
plunging gladly into it, she swam through
an arch under the hedge, and along some
meadows, till she came to a pond, where, to
her great delight, she found several of her
own relations enjoying an early swim. She
told them her story, with many tears and
complaints, as she had done to Cockielockie
and poor Miss Peck, and begged to know
whether she might remain with them, and
so escape for ever from the tyranny and
insolence of Mrs. Topknot and Jem the
carter.</p>

<p class='c008'>They told her that she was welcome to
stay if she pleased, but it was right to mention
that they were particularly subject to
very severe misfortunes, in the frequent
losses sustained by their families, as there
was a house very near them, in which a large
table was kept, and at any moment one of
them might be seized, and taken in to stand
upon this table, but not one had ever been
brought back again. Duckiedaddles, however,
thought that they only said this to
frighten her, and felt quite sure that she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>should be much happier here than at home,
so she stayed, and led an easy life with her
new friends—except a dispute every now and
then—for some time, when, one morning, as
they were going down to the pond, she and
Curlytail were not to be seen amongst them,
so they knew directly that they were taken
in to stand upon the great table, and would
never come out and swim in the pleasant
water any more.</p>

<p class='c008'>Goosiepoosie’s story is soon told. She
first flew over the hedge, and nearly
frightened a red cow, who was lying in the
grass on the other side, into fits; and then,
recovering her own senses, set off home as
fast as she could go. When she arrived
there, she called all her companions around
her, and told them that, after travelling a
long way, and inquiring everywhere, she
found that the Queen’s house was not in
any part of this country, and she was afraid
that they should never be able to reach it;
but, that if they waited quietly, perhaps
there might be some opportunity of offering
up a petition to her on the subject of their
complaint. So the geese consented to wait,
and as no opportunity of presenting their
petition ever occurred, they have continued
to wear their white coats ever since.</p>

<p class='c008'>Poor Cockielockie had a dismal time of it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>before he came to the end of <i>his</i> troubles.
He, too, had flown over the hedge on the
other side, and in his great terror, continued,
sometimes flying, and sometimes running,
till he came to a copse, where he thought he
should be safe; so he lay down in the thick
grass, under a tree, scared and tired, and
very much out of breath. Hearing nothing
of his companions, and not seeing anything
to alarm him, he remained there till the
morning, dozing a little, and dreaming of
the old cat, and Mrs. Cockielockie, and
every now and then, starting up in the belief
that all Farmer Cloverfield’s waggons and
horses were coming down the lane at full
gallop, and that he had not time to get out
of the way. All that day he wandered unhappily
about the copse, picking up a few
insects, but meeting with no acquaintance,
and not able to find any way out, he felt
very lonely and wretched, and when the daylight
was nearly gone, he climbed up into a
hazel tree, and tried to go to sleep. But
there was such a rustling and twittering
amongst a family of robins, who lodged just
below him, and who were talking over their
plans for the winter, and the changes which
they meant to make in the spring, that it
was long before he could close his eyes. He
had barely done so, when a sudden rush
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>from below, and frightful sounds of pain and
terror roused him from his short slumber.
He flew instantly to the ground, and there,
in the twilight, he distinctly saw his former
companion, the old cat, standing with two
murdered robins at her feet, while she
greedily devoured a third.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, Mrs. Puss,” said he, for her
mouth was too full to allow her to speak
first, “may I ask how you came here, and
what you are doing?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How came I here!” said she, swallowing
down the last wing of the robin as fast as
she could. “I should think I had as much
business here as you have, Mr. Cockielockie,
particularly if the old woman sends me, to
get her a few nice little birds for her dinner
to-morrow. Of course I must taste them
first myself, to see whether they are tough,
and I am sure the one I have just swallowed
was tough enough to choke me. I wonder
how I could get it down at all. I hope, for
the old woman’s sake, that the others will
be more tender. And, perhaps, you will be
good enough to tell me, Mr. Cockielockie,
where you have been all this time, for there
has been such a to-do at home about you,
as never was known since Dame Featherleg
drowned herself in the well: Mrs. Cockielockie
in hysterics, all your family sobbing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>and sighing, and the old woman giving you
up for lost, and hobbling off to Farmer
Cloverfield’s to inquire whether Mr. Brush
had been seen in the neighbourhood lately.
For goodness’ sake go home as fast as you
can, and make their minds easy, or Mrs.
Cockielockie will be setting off in search of
you, with all the family. If there should be
anything that you do not wish mentioned,
you may depend, Mr. Cockielockie, on my
keeping it to myself, for I always say, the
best of us would sometimes get into trouble,
if our friends made a point of repeating every
little thing that they might happen to know
about us, that seemed to them contrary to
one’s duty, and all that! So, if you will just
take that turning to the right, Mr. Cockielockie,
and then the next to the left, you will
be on the way to the cottage, and I will come
after you as soon as I have convinced myself
that these nasty birds are too tough to be
worth carrying home, which I strongly suspect
to be the case. We shall have plenty
of time to talk over our adventures as we
walk along, for it is a good step from hence
for you, though nothing for me, who am an
excellent walker.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Cockielockie thanked Mrs. Puss for her
directions, and immediately set off on the
way she pointed out, feeling very thankful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>for the prospect of returning to his family,
and sleeping once more in his comfortable
old place in the yew-tree. When Mrs. Puss,
who very soon came up with him, as she
promised, heard his story, she said, that if
he took her advice, he would never set off
on such an errand again, for if anything so
important as the stars falling out of the sky,
had really happened, she and the old woman
should have been sure to hear of it, and
could let the Queen know, without troubling
a meddlesome person like Miss Peck, to
whom Her Majesty would never have
thought of listening for a moment.</p>

<p class='c008'>So Cockielockie lived very quietly with
the old woman ever after; the Queen has
never been told from that day to this that
the stars were falling out of the sky, and
things have gone on much the same notwithstanding.
Indeed, I know some people
who think it a great pity that Miss Peck and
her companions did not stay at home, and
mind their own concerns. If they had but
thought less of themselves, they would not
have been so discontented with their condition,
but there is an old proverb that, “to
a crazy ship all winds are contrary,” and as,
according to another homely saying, “Every
path has a puddle,” those who spend their
time in complaining, and turning this way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>and that, to escape from things that they do
not like, and to better themselves in the
world, are neither likely to be very useful
to others, or to lead happy and prosperous
lives themselves.</p>
